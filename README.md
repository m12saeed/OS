The Round-robin scheduling algorithm is a kind of preemptive First come, First Serve CPU Scheduling algorithm where each process in the ready state gets the CPU for a fixed time in a cyclic way (turn by turn). It is the oldest scheduling algorithm, which is mainly used for multitasking.

Shortest Job First (SJF) is a type of disk scheduling algorithm in the operating system in which the processor executes the job first that has the smallest execution time. In the shortest Job First algorithm, the processes are scheduled according to the burst time of these processes.
